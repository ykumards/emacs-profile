# emacs config

I used to use spacemacs for my emacs profile, but it just got bloated out of control. When things went wrong, I had no idea why it went wrong and had to waste hours googling for a solution. It is better to start fresh with a clean emacs distribution. 

Still had to use a starter kit (who likes to write boilerplate :D), so am using this awesome dot-file collection from Daniel Higginbottom.
