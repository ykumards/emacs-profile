** 13:32 Week 28 Retro

I had some good revelations this week. It was possibly one of the most depressing one's in some time. And I mean the word depression literally here. I was completely drowning with thoughts of self-doubt and thinking deeply about "the point of all this" throughout the week. On Friday however, I had some useful revelations that I noted down somewhere. It was to simplify my life as much as possible when it comes to work. In research work, for examples, I clearly have to spend a lot of time thinking about some original ideas or an implementation of an old idea in an original setting. This is demanding and educational in itself and I don't have to be spending the time to setup my own codebase for such experiments (at least at the initial stages) when a tool like lightning is available just for this purpose. Yes, the guy who started this tool is kinda an ass, but what do I have to do about it. I am not going to buy anything from him, my job is only to use this tool that he started to simplify my life. I used to think that writing my own codebase is going to be beneficial because I would start to understand the fundamentals of these topics but I have to do that after all the experiments are done, for now I just have to focus on solving the problem as quickly as possible. 

I am getting some amount of anciety due to no finising the stupid idea that PM had wanted me to work on. I realize that I do have to complete it during these 5 weeks, but I have to back it up with much better progress in this other project and also justification as to why his idea is not really all that good. This will indeed take some time and I have to allocate my time accordingly. 

Problems in this week: I did end up playing a lot of COD. I maintained the meditation streak during the initial days but I also
