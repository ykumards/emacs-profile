Tackling this month will be very important because I have the peace of mind without any distractions. However, when I do have a lot of time at hand, I tend to spend it on doing things that are not really important and eventually, I end up wasting all the time. That's why I am back to the tried and tested world of org mode and now I think I can focus completely on just having one interface to handle all my organization stuff.
I have to come up with my own ideas for turning into a proper paper by the end of this month. This means I should be done with all the initial level experiments of this work. However, I have to also do some of the things that I had promised to the idiot so he doesn't feel like I just abandoned it right away. The important point here is that I should convey with evidence that my idea is doable by the AAAI deadline and that I should be focussed on that for now, and slowly push his shit out by the end of the year. Quite simple, this is the plan for the month. While I do realize that completely going against him will be a satisfactory thing to do, I will have to face a lot of backlash and bad blood as a result of it. The simple rule is that I should not be doing anything that will affect my peace of mind and having a full blown ego war with your advisor is not going to be peaceful. 
More on this later but for this week, I should focus on implementing my own idea and coming up with a more concrete plan.

I had a start with the seqCFI today. Spent part of the evening working with sequential generation models again, it is a much better state of mind to be in compared to the crap that all this probabilistic thinking is. I hope I get some results on this by the end of this month. 
I have to first get an intuitive understanding of transformers before I can move onto work with more complicated models. So today, I will just go through the annotated transformers paper in colab.

**** Week 28: Notes
This week I should focus on the routine more than anything else. I seemed to have stepped off the gas just a bit, and quite understandbly because the last few weeks before this have been a bit hard, but this does not mean that I should lose this great opportunity to just focus and get some work done without any interruptions from the bayesian nutjob.
*** Week 29 (Jul 12 - 18)
